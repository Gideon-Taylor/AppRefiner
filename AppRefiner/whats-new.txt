NEW FEATURES
============

Enhanced Editor & Parameter Name Inlay Hints
----------------------------------------------
• Parameter Name Inlay Hints - Function parameter names displayed as inline hints at call sites,
  including inside object constructors. Requires the "Use Enhanced Editor" setting to be enabled.
• Enhanced Editor - Opt-in setting (General Settings > Feature Overrides > "Use Enhanced Editor")
  loads a modified Scintilla editor at runtime. Your Application Designer files are NOT modified —
  this is a runtime-only change. A restart of Application Designer is required.

Code Quality & Styling
-----------------------
• Invalid Member Access Styler - Highlights invalid member access such as calling a non-existent
  method or property on a typed object

Editor Enhancements
---------------------
• Toggle Line Comment - Comment or uncomment selected lines with Ctrl+/ using aligned block
  comment markers (<* ... *>)
• Document Minimap - A minimap overview of your code displayed alongside the editor, default state set via
  AppRefiner settings. Toggle-able via the AppRefiner button in the editor.
• Smart Paste - When pasting text into a string literal, special characters are automatically escaped
• AppRefiner Button - New in-editor button with a context menu offering quick access to the
  Command Palette, Toggle Minimap, and Toggle Parameter Names (if enabled).

Language Extensions
--------------------
• Array .Filter() - New language extension for filtering arrays
• %Response.HTMLLine() - New type extension that makes appending a break tag automatic


IMPROVEMENTS
============

• Go To Definition - Now works on chained member access expressions (e.g. thing.property.method())
• Declare Function - Improved behavior in various contexts
• Autocomplete Conflict Warning - Alert when both AppRefiner and App Designer autocompletions are
  enabled simultaneously
• Language Extensions - Support for implicit parameters and contextual usage info for transforms
• Plugin UX - Improved plugin management and fixed duplication issue with plugin
  commands/linters/refactors
• Dark Mode - Properly style /* */ block comments
• Improved highlighting in function call tips


BUG FIXES
=========

• Fix false reports of unused imports
• Fix issue where function call tip shows the wrong one
• Fix issue with string interpolation that prevents sequential interpolation blocks from parsing
  correctly
• Fix issue with using ":" as a fillup character in Tools 8.60
• Only check for call tips and interpolated strings in PeopleCode editors
