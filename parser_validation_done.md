# Parser Validation Completed

This file contains parser rules that have been validated against the ANTLR grammar and corrected in the C# self-hosted parser.

## Completed Rules

### Core Program Structure
- [x] **importsBlock** - container for import declarations
  - Behavior matches grammar: zero or more import declarations handled in program entry pre-pass.
  - No code changes required beyond ensuring `importDeclaration` consumes SEMI+.
  - Grammar Reference: importsBlock/importDeclaration lines 30-36.
- [x] **program** - main entry point for PeopleCode programs
  - **Issue Found**: Parser didn't follow the strict grammar alternation between `appClass` OR `importsBlock programPreambles? SEMI* statements? SEMI* EOF`
  - **Fix Applied**: Restructured ParseProgram() to properly handle the two distinct program formats according to ANTLR grammar
  - **Grammar Reference**: Lines 20-23 in PeopleCodeParser.g4
  - **Files Modified**: PeopleCodeParser.SelfHosted\PeopleCodeParser.cs:235-391
  - **Date Completed**: 2025-01-22
