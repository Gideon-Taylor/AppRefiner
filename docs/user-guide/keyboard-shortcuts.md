# Keyboard Shortcuts

AppRefiner provides numerous keyboard shortcuts to enhance your productivity while working in PeopleSoft Application Designer. This guide lists all available shortcuts organized by category.

## Command Palette

The Command Palette is the central access point for AppRefiner's functionality:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Open Command Palette |

The Command Palette works similarly to VS Code, providing quick access to all AppRefiner features directly within Application Designer.

## General Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+L` | Run active linters on the current program and show results as inline annotations |
| `Ctrl+Shift+I` | Resolve Imports (scan for App Classes and ensure they are imported) |

## Code Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Left` | Collapse Current Level |
| `Alt+Right` | Expand Current Level |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Left` | Collapse All |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Right` | Expand All |

## Code Folding

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt+Left` | Collapse Current Block |
| `Alt+Right` | Expand Current Block |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Left` | Collapse All Blocks |
| `Ctrl+Alt+Right` | Expand All Blocks |

## Code Refactoring

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Rename (local/instance variables, parameters, private methods) |

## Customizing Shortcuts

Currently, AppRefiner does not support customizing keyboard shortcuts. However custom built plugins (linters/stylers/refactors) are able to register their own keyboard shortcuts.
