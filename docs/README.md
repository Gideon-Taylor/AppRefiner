# AppRefiner Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive information about AppRefiner, a companion application designed to enhance PeopleSoft's Application Designer with modern development features.

## Overview

AppRefiner is a powerful companion application that runs alongside PeopleSoft's Application Designer to augment and enhance the developer experience. It adds modern IDE features such as code folding, linting, syntax highlighting, and refactoring tools that are not available in the native Application Designer environment.

Rather than replacing Application Designer, AppRefiner seamlessly integrates with it to provide additional functionality while you work with PeopleCode. The most efficient way to access AppRefiner's features is through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), which works similarly to VS Code and provides quick access to all functionality.
