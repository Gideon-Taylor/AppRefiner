# Dark Mode

Dark Mode in AppRefiner provides a low-light interface that reduces eye strain and is ideal for working in dimly lit environments.

## Overview

AppRefiner's Dark Mode transforms the code editor into a dark-themed color scheme. This feature is designed to reduce eye strain during extended coding sessions and provide a modern, sleek appearance.

## Benefits

- **Reduced eye strain**: Lower brightness and contrast are easier on the eyes, especially during long coding sessions
- **Reduced blue light**: Dark backgrounds emit less blue light, which can help with sleep patterns if you code at night
- **Improved focus**: The dark background can help highlight syntax coloring and make code stand out more clearly

## Enabling Dark Mode

Dark Mode can be enabled by executing the Dark Mode command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).

**Note**: Currently this is a one-way transformation, there is no undo. To reset the editor's appearance, simply close and reopen PeopleCode/HTML/SQL defintion.
