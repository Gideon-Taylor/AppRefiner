# Dark Mode

Dark Mode in AppRefiner provides a low-light interface that reduces eye strain and is ideal for working in dimly lit environments.

## Overview

AppRefiner's Dark Mode transforms the entire application interface, including the code editor, panels, menus, and dialogs, into a dark-themed color scheme. This feature is designed to reduce eye strain during extended coding sessions and provide a modern, sleek appearance.

## Benefits

- **Reduced eye strain**: Lower brightness and contrast are easier on the eyes, especially during long coding sessions
- **Reduced blue light**: Dark backgrounds emit less blue light, which can help with sleep patterns if you code at night
- **Battery conservation**: On devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, dark mode can help conserve battery life
- **Improved focus**: The dark background can help highlight syntax coloring and make code stand out more clearly

## Enabling Dark Mode

To enable Dark Mode in AppRefiner:

1. Go to **Tools > Options > Environment**
2. Under **Visual Experience**, select **Dark** from the **Color theme** dropdown
