# Suppressing Lint Warnings

While lint warnings are valuable for maintaining code quality, there are legitimate cases where you may need to suppress them. AppRefiner provides several methods to suppress lint warnings in your code.

## Why Suppress Warnings?

There are several valid reasons to suppress lint warnings:

1. **False positives**: When a lint rule incorrectly flags valid code
2. **Legacy code**: When working with older code that cannot be immediately refactored
3. **Special cases**: When you have a specific reason to deviate from the standard
4. **Generated code**: For automatically generated code that you don't control
5. **Third-party code**: For code from external sources that you cannot modify

## Suppression Methods

AppRefiner provides multiple ways to suppress lint warnings using special comment directives.

### Suppression Comment Format

All suppression comments use the following format:

```peoplecode
/* #AppRefiner suppress (LINTER_ID:ReportNumber, ANOTHER_ID:ReportNumber) */
```

You can specify multiple suppressions by separating them with commas. Each suppression consists of a linter ID followed by a colon and a report number.

### 1. Global Suppression

To suppress warnings for the entire file, place a suppression comment at the top of the file, before any imports or class declarations:

```peoplecode
/* #AppRefiner suppress (CODE_STYLE:1, NAMING:2) */
import PTCS_PORTAL:*;

class MyClass 
{
    // All CODE_STYLE:1 and NAMING:2 warnings are suppressed in this file
}
```

### 2. Scope Suppression

To suppress warnings for a specific method, function, or code block, place a suppression comment immediately before the scope declaration:

```peoplecode
/* #AppRefiner suppress (COMPLEXITY:3) */
method ComplexMethod()
    // All COMPLEXITY:3 warnings are suppressed in this method
end-method;

/* #AppRefiner suppress (PERFORMANCE:2) */
If &condition Then
    // All PERFORMANCE:2 warnings are suppressed in this if block
End-If;
```

Scope suppression works with the following code blocks:
- Methods
- Functions
- Getters and Setters
- If statements
- For loops
- While loops
- Repeat loops
- Evaluate statements
- Try-catch blocks

### 3. Line-specific Suppression

To suppress warnings for a specific line, place a suppression comment immediately above the line:

```peoplecode
/* #AppRefiner suppress (PERFORMANCE:4) */
Local number &result = ExpensiveOperation();  // This line is suppressed
```

### 4. Wildcard Suppression

To suppress all reports from a specific linter, use the wildcard syntax (`*`):

```peoplecode
/* #AppRefiner suppress (SQL_EXEC:*) */
// Suppresses all SQL_EXEC linter warnings
```

## Best Practices for Suppressing Warnings

### 1. Document Your Suppressions

Always include a comment explaining why you're suppressing a warning:

```peoplecode
/* 
 * #AppRefiner suppress (UNUSED_VAR:1)
 * This variable is required for the third-party API but not used directly
 */
Local string &apiRequiredVar;
```

### 2. Use the Most Specific Suppression

Apply suppressions at the most specific level possible:

- Use line-specific suppressions instead of scope suppressions
- Use scope suppressions instead of global suppressions

### 3. Regularly Review Suppressions

Periodically review your code to see if suppressions can be removed:

1. Search for `#AppRefiner suppress` comments in your codebase
2. Evaluate if the suppression is still necessary
3. Consider refactoring the code to fix the underlying issue

## Example Scenarios

### Suppressing Multiple Warnings

```peoplecode
/* 
 * #AppRefiner suppress (COMPLEX_FUNC:1, LONG_FUNC:2)
 * This function is complex due to business requirements
 * and will be refactored in the next release
 */
Function CalculateComplexFormula(&input As number) Returns number
   /* Complex calculation with many branches... */
End-Function;
```

### Suppressing Warnings for Generated Code

```peoplecode
/* 
 * #AppRefiner suppress (CODE_STYLE:*, NAMING:*)
 * This file is auto-generated by the AppGenerator tool.
 * Do not modify directly.
 */

/* Generated code... */
```
