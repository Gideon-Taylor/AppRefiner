# Linting Overview

Linting in AppRefiner is a powerful code analysis feature that helps identify potential errors, bugs, and stylistic issues in your PeopleCode directly within PeopleSoft Application Designer. It analyzes your code when explicitly run and provides feedback through inline annotations.

## Key Aspects of Linting

-   **Identify Issues**: Catches potential bugs, violations of best practices, and suspicious code constructs.
-   **Improve Quality**: Helps enforce coding standards and maintain code readability.
-   **Contextual Feedback**: Shows issues directly within the Application Designer editor.
